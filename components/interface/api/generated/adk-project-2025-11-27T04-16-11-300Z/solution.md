ISSUES FOUND:
- The frontend is built using `react-scripts` (Create React App), but production-ready standards require a more modern and performant build tool like Vite. The checklist explicitly states to REJECT projects using create-react-app without Vite.
- The `package.json` `scripts` object is incomplete. It contains `start` and `build` but is missing the required `dev` and `preview` scripts, which are standard in modern frontend toolchains like Vite.
- The application lacks client-side routing. The checklist requires the inclusion of `React Router` or an equivalent for navigation and multiple views, but the project is a single-component application.
- The application does not have multiple pages or views (e.g., Home, About, Dashboard). It consists of a single page, which violates the requirement for a multi-view structure.
- In `backend/app.py`, the database initialization check (`os.path.exists`) runs inside an `@app.before_request` hook. This performs a filesystem check on every single incoming API request, which is highly inefficient and not a production-ready pattern. Database setup should be a separate, one-time command.
- In `backend/models.py`, a new database connection is established and closed within each function (`get_all_workouts`, `add_workout`). This is inefficient and can lead to performance bottlenecks. A better practice is to manage the database connection at the application or request context level.
- The frontend file structure is too simplistic for a production application. All logic is contained within a single `App.js` file. A proper structure would separate concerns into different files and directories, such as `components/`, `hooks/`, or `services/`.
