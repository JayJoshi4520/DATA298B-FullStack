ISSUES FOUND:
- **Critical Logic Bug in Backend (main.py):** The image processing logic in `predict_digit` is flawed. The line `image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(contents)).convert("L")` incorrectly handles PNGs with transparency (which HTML Canvas produces by default). Converting an RGBA image (Transparent background + Black ink) to 'L' (Grayscale) simply ignores the alpha channel, turning transparent pixels Black. Since the ink is also Black, the result is a completely black image. The backend **must** composite the incoming RGBA image onto a white background before converting to grayscale and inverting.
- **Brittle Frontend Implementation (App.jsx):** The line `const canvas = canvasRef.current.canvasContainer.children[1];` is extremely brittle as it relies on the internal DOM structure of the `react-canvas-draw` library, which is subject to change. It also assumes the second child is always the drawing layer. Please use the library's public API methods (e.g., `getDataURL`) or a more robust method to retrieve the image data.
- **Missing Environment Configuration:** Hardcoding `http://localhost:8000` in `App.jsx` works for local Docker Compose but is not production-ready. While acceptable for a scaffold, it's better practice to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` with a fallback. However, the image processing bug above is the primary reason for rejection.
