ISSUES FOUND:
- **Missing Core Functionality (Routing):** The application is a single page/view and lacks routing. The strict review checklist requires the implementation of routing (e.g., using `react-router-dom`), which is a standard feature for production-ready single-page applications, even if to delineate different sections or prepare for future expansion.
- **Missing Core Functionality (Navigation):** As a direct consequence of the lack of routing, there is no navigation system (e.g., a navbar with links). This fails the "Must include working navigation" requirement.
- **Production Readiness Risk (Backend DB Connection Leak):** In `backend/app.py`, the `add_workout` function does not guarantee that the database connection is closed if an error occurs after the connection is opened but before `conn.close()` is called. A `try...finally` block should be used to ensure `conn.close()` is always executed. This is a potential resource leak and is not acceptable for production code.
- **Configuration Redundancy (Nginx):** The `frontend/nginx.conf` file contains two separate `location` blocks to handle API proxying (`location /api` and `location ~ ^/api/`). This is redundant and confusing. A single, well-defined location block (e.g., `location /api/`) should be used to handle all API proxying to avoid ambiguity and simplify the configuration.
