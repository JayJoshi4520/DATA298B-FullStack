ISSUES FOUND:
- **Critical Orchestration Error:** In `docker-compose.yml`, the backend service defines a volume mount `- ./backend:/app`. The `Dockerfile` runs `python train.py` during the build phase to generate `model.pth` and `vocab.json` inside the image at `/app`. However, at runtime, the volume mount overlays the host's `./backend` directory (which likely does not contain these generated files yet) onto `/app`, effectively hiding the trained model from the container. The application will fail to start because `model.pth` will be not found. **Fix:** Remove the `volumes` section for the `backend` service in `docker-compose.yml` to ensure the container uses the pre-built image artifacts containing the trained model.
- **Minor:** Ensure `prepare_data.py` logic handles the file paths safely if the directory is not writable (though in Docker it usually is). The current implementation is fine, but the volume mount issue is the primary blocker.
