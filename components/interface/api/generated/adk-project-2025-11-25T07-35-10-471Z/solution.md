ISSUES FOUND:
- **Use of Outdated Tooling:** The frontend project uses `react-scripts` (Create React App), which is no longer the recommended tool for starting React projects. The review criteria explicitly state to **REJECT** projects using `create-react-app`. Modern projects should use a build tool like Vite.
- **Critical Runtime Error in Backend:** The file `backend/main.py` uses a relative import `from .models import Note, NoteCreate`. When running the application with `uvicorn main:app` from the `backend/` directory, this will raise an `ImportError` because Python does not treat the directory as a package in that context. The import must be absolute: `from models import Note, NoteCreate`.
- **Typo in HTML Charset:** The file `frontend/public/index.html` contains a critical typo in the character set declaration: `<meta charset="utf-á" />`. This should be `<meta charset="utf-8" />`. This will cause character encoding and rendering issues in the browser.
- **Missing Environment Variable Documentation:** The React application in `frontend/src/App.js` uses `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`, but the project is missing a `.env.example` file to document this required environment variable. This is not production-ready.
- **Missing Standard `dev` Script:** The `package.json` for the frontend is missing a `dev` script, which is a standard convention. While `start` is used by CRA, a `dev` script is expected for consistency.
- **Use of Deprecated Pydantic `Config`:** The file `backend/models.py` uses the `class Config:` inner class with `from_attributes = True`. In Pydantic v2 (which is used by recent FastAPI versions), this is deprecated and should be replaced with `model_config = {"from_attributes": True}`.
- **Single Component Application:** The entire frontend is a single `App.js` component. A production-ready application would typically separate concerns into multiple components (e.g., `NoteList`, `NoteForm`, `NoteCard`).
- **No Routing:** The application lacks client-side routing. While not explicitly required for this simple CRUD, any real-world application would require a routing library like `react-router-dom` to handle different views.
- **Insecure Use of `global`:** The `backend/main.py` uses a `global` variable (`last_id`) to manage the in-memory database's auto-incrementing ID. This is not thread-safe and is considered poor practice for anything beyond a simple demonstration.
