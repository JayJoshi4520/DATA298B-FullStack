ISSUES FOUND:
- **Inconsistent API Configuration**: In `frontend/src/App.jsx`, the `API_URL` is hardcoded to `http://localhost:8000`, which ignores the proxy configuration set up in `vite.config.js`. This is not production-ready. You must use relative paths (e.g., `/api/health`, `/api/train`) so requests are routed through the Vite proxy. This avoids hardcoded origins in the source code and ensures the proxy rewrite logic is actually used.
- **Deprecated FastAPI Pattern**: `backend/main.py` uses `@app.on_event("startup")`, which is deprecated in modern FastAPI versions (0.93+). Since you are pinning `fastapi==0.109.0`, you must use the `lifespan` context manager approach for managing startup/shutdown logic and global state.
- **Unnecessary Dependency**: `backend/requirements.txt` includes `python-multipart`, but the application uses standard JSON bodies (Pydantic models) for `POST /predict` and no body for `POST /train`. `python-multipart` is only required for Form Data or File Uploads and should be removed to keep the build clean.
- **Code Consistency**: Ensure the frontend `App.jsx` uses the `API_URL` variable consistently or relative paths directly, matching the `vite.config.js` proxy settings (`/api` prefix).
