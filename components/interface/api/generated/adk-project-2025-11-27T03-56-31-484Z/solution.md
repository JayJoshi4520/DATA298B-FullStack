ISSUES FOUND:
- The frontend project is configured using `react-scripts` (create-react-app). The strict guidelines require using Vite for modern React projects.
- The application is a single-page implementation and lacks routing (e.g., `react-router-dom`), which is a requirement for a multi-view application structure.
- The application does not contain multiple pages or views (e.g., Home, Dashboard) as required by the component completeness checklist. It only has one main view in `App.js`.
- The frontend `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are configured for development, not production. The `CMD ["npm", "start"]` runs the development server, and `volumes` are used to mount source code. A production setup would build static assets (`npm run build`) and serve them with a web server like Nginx.
- The `backend/requirements.txt` was requested to include `sqlite3`, but it was omitted. While `sqlite3` is part of the Python standard library and does not need to be installed via pip, this is a deviation from the user's explicit request.
- The `docker-compose.yml` for the frontend maps the host port `4000` to the container port `3000`. This works, but it can be confusing. The internal `EXPOSE 3000` in the Dockerfile and the `react-scripts start` command default to port 3000. For consistency, it would be better if the documentation clearly explained this port mapping.
