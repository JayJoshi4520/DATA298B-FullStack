ISSUES FOUND:
- **Missing Core Functionality (Routing):** The application lacks client-side routing. The checklist explicitly requires "Must include routing (React Router or Vue Router)". A production-ready Single Page Application (SPA) must demonstrate the ability to manage multiple views/pages. The current implementation is only a single, non-navigable view. `vue-router` should be added as a dependency and configured.
- **Incomplete Component Structure:** The application does not meet the requirement of having "multiple pages/views (Home, About, Dashboard, etc.)". It consists of only a single `App.vue` file. This is not representative of a complete, production-ready application structure.
- **Missing Navigation:** As a direct result of the lack of routing, the application fails the requirement to "include working navigation". There is no navigation bar, menu, or links to switch between different sections of the application.
- **Unused Directory:** The scaffolding script creates an empty directory at `frontend/src/components`. Scaffolding empty, unused directories is a sign of an incomplete or non-production-ready template. All created directories should serve a purpose in the initial build.
