ISSUES FOUND:
- **Hardcoded Absolute Path:** The script hardcodes `base_path = "/home/coder/project/mnist_digit_classifier"`. The user's logs indicate they are running on macOS (`/Users/jayjoshi/...`). Running this script as-is on the user's machine will fail (trying to write to a non-existent `/home/coder` directory) or create files in the wrong location. The script should use `os.getcwd()` or relative paths (`.`) to be portable and run safely in the user's current directory.
- **CMD Assumption:** The backend Dockerfile forces `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`. While the requirements allow this assumption, a more robust approach (or a comment to the user) is preferred if the file structure isn't confirmed, as this will crash if the entry point is `main.py` or `server.py`. (The hardcoded path is the primary blocking issue, however).
- **Vite/React Port Mapping Risk:** The `docker-compose.yml` maps host 4000 to container 3000 for the frontend. If the project uses Vite (likely given modern defaults), it defaults to port 5173, not 3000. Unless the existing `vite.config.js` sets the port to 3000, the container will start but be unreachable at port 4000. Since we are patching infrastructure, we should ensure the frontend Dockerfile or Compose command handles this (e.g., passing `PORT=3000` or modifying the command), or explicitly note the requirement.

**Remediation Required:**
1. Change `base_path` to use `os.getcwd()` or `.` to ensure it works in the user's terminal.
2. Ensure the code is portable.
